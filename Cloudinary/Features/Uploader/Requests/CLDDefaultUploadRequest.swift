 A `CLDUploadRequest` object is returned when creating a data transfer request to Cloudinary, e.g. uploading a file.
 It allows the options to add a progress closure that is called periodically during the transfer
 and a response closure to be called once the transfer has finished,
 as well as performing actions on the request, such as cancelling, suspending or resuming it.
